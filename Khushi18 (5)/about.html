    <p>"Hello! My name is Khushi Wagle, and I'm currently a student in 
        grade 9 at Mount View English Boarding School. As I navigate through my 
        high school journey, I'm enthusiastic about exploring various subjects and 
        activities to broaden my knowledge and skills. I strive to make the most of my time at Mount View 
        by actively participating in academic pursuits, extracurricular activities, and forming meaningful
         connections with my peers. I'm excited to embark on this educational adventure and discover more 
         about myself along the way.
